# port_scanner
A simple port scanner and optional support for banner grabbing too


It could be used for both an ipv4 address or hostname .
 
Use simple port scan to find the open ports and fasten up the process of scanning.

Use banner grabbing when needed but it might execute a bit slow as no threading is used.


I will soon upload a threaded version to fasten up the process of scanning.
